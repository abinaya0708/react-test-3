        1. What is the output of below code?
        import { useState } from 'react';

        export const  Counter=()=> { 
        const [counter, setCounter] = useState(5);
        return ( <>     
            < span>{counter}< /span>       
            < button onClick={ ( ) => {      
            setCounter(counter + 5);         
            setCounter(counter + 5);              
            alert(counter);         
            setCounter(counter + 5);                   
            setCounter(counter + 5); 
              }}>Increment< /button>     </>   ) } 
                               
         output:5   alert:5 
         if click alert button output:  10   alert :10

         2.What will be the output of the below code if the button is clicked:
 
         function App() { 
          const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
          useEffect(() => {
          console.log("Component rendered successfully");   }, []); 
          return (
          < div> 
                < button onClick={ ( ) => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me< /button>
                < p>You clicked {count} time< /p>
          < /div>   ); }      
         
         output:You clicked 1 time   
        console---Component rendered successfully

         3.How do you create forms in React?  

         In React, forms are created using the HTML <form> tag just like in regular HTML. However, React has its own way of handling form data that differs from traditional HTML/JavaScript forms. Unlike HTML/JavaScript, React forms rely on a single source of truth: the component state.
         Ex:< form>
             < label>Input Value:< /label>
             < input  type="number"  value={num} onChange={handleChange} />
             < /form>
             < p>Input Value: {num}< /p> 
             < /form>
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         4. Explain lifecycle methods.   
         
         
        In React, components have a lifecycle that consists of different phases. Each phase has a set of lifecycle methods that are called at specific points in the component's lifecycle. These methods allow you to control the component's behavior and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle.
          A component's lifecycle has three main phases: 
          =>the Mounting Phase,
           =>the Updating Phase,
            => and the Unmounting Phase.

         5.Can web browsers read JSX directly?  


         Browsers cannot read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand it. You can use babel to transform your jsx into native javascript and HTML which browser can understand. React uses JSX (JavaScript eXtension) that allows us to write JavaScript that looks like HTML.
         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         6.How Do You Handle Forms in React?

        To handle form submission, you can use the handleSubmit function. In this example, we pass the onSubmit function to the handleSubmit function. The onSubmit function will be called when the form is submitted and will receive an object containing the values of each form field.

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         7.What is virtual dom in the react?    

         
        React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory. Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM. React only changes what needs to be changed!

         8.In React, Why Is There a Need for Using Keys in Lists?

         A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted.

        Keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists. It is recommended to use a string as a key that uniquely identifies the items in the list.  

 
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         9.What Is the Difference Between State and Props in React? 

         Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, while state is used to manage data within a component. Props are immutable and cannot be changed within a component, while state is mutable and can be updated using the setState function.
